This is just an experiment. It might work, it might not.

The aim of the project is to replace in entirity the woefully unloved "Tagging
Guide (for OSM Contributors)" at
[http://www.gravitystorm.co.uk/shine/cycle-info/ with something a bit more
user-friendly, while maintaining editorial control and not descending into
mayhem. I'm looking at you, wiki.openstreetmap.org :-) . I take inspiration from
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/

# Contributing

It's really easy to contribute, and I welcome your proposals!

## Quick changes

If you are viewing this on github.com, just find the file you want to change
(likely in the _posts folder) and find the button that says "Edit this file".
Make your changes, and they'll be submitted for review

## In-depth

The project is based on the [jekyll markdown
engine](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Clone the repository, install
jekyll, and run

    jekyll --server --auto

for best results. There's a whole load of jekyll that I don't know yet, so feel
free to enlighten me.
