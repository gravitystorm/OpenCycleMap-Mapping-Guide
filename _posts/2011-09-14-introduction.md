title: The OpenCycleMap Mapping Guide - Introduction

{{ page.title }}
================

[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) is a wonderful project, and it's where OpenCycleMap gets almost all of its data from. However, one of the very fundamental things - that you can tag anything, any way you like, is also a bit intimidating.

This guide explains how to tag things that are relevant to cyclists. OpenCycleMap can't and won't show every detail in OpenStreetMap, but these may be used by other projects that use OSM data.
